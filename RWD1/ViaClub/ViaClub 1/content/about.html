                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p> The Vellcity Athletics club, also known as VIA Club, founded almost a hundred years ago in Horsens which is located in on the east coast of Jutland region. The club itself was founded by legendary athlete Robert Sixpack. The goal of the club was for locals to be able to participate in many different indoor sports activities, but funnily enough for the past 55 years it has mainly consisted of the local outdoor football club which has received relative success compared to its size. Not being known as the biggest, but rather for its dedicated and loyal fanbase. The current manager, who has been with the club for 29 years, Bob Oldenuff has been with throughout the good and the bad with the club. </p>
